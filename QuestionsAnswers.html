<h1>Appendix. Q&A and Supplement Materials</h1>

<p>This appendix serves as some supplement materials which will or will not be mentioned in talks, depending on their length of the whole context. Problems arising in talks that are not solved immediately would be stated and solved here.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="hermitian connection">The hermitian connection</h2> In this section we are going to prove an equivalence between two different definitions of hermitian connections on an hermitian vector bundle. Let \(X\) be a differentiable manifold and \(E\to X\) an hermitian vector bundle over \(X\), then we have the hermitian inner product \(h\) defined on \(E\), which is called an hermitian structure in section <a href="1.Introduction.html#1c">1c)</a>.

<p><div class="s definition"></div>An <b class="textbf">hermitian connection</b> on \(E\) is a connection \(\nabla\) such that it is compactible with the real inner product \(\mathrm{Re} h\) and is complex linear. In other words, if we write \(\langle -,-\rangle =\mathrm{Re} h(-,-)\), then the hermitian connection must satisfy the Lebnitz rule
$$
\mathrm{d}\langle s_1 ,s_2\rangle =\langle\nabla s_1 ,s_2\rangle +\langle s_1 ,\nabla s_2\rangle,
$$
and the additional requirement that \(\nabla (Js)=J\nabla s\) for all sections \(s\). Here the complex structure acts on the tensor bundle \(E\otimes T^{\ast} X\) by \(J\otimes\mathrm{id}\).</p>

The main result of this section is the following

<p><div class="s prp"></div>A connection \(\nabla\) on the hermitian vector bundle \(E\to X\) is an hermitian connection if and only if for any sections \(s_1 ,s_2\) on \(E\), we have
$$
\mathrm{d} h(s_1 ,s_2)=h(\nabla s_1 ,s_2 )+h(s_1 ,\nabla s_2).
$$</p>

<p class="proof">This follows from the following linear-algebraic fact: since the complex structure \(J\) on \(E\) is compactible with the hermitian structure \(h\), we have
    $$
    h(s_1 ,Js_2 )=-ih(s_1 ,s_2).
    $$
    Decompose \(h\) into a sum of real parts and imagine parts, and we write the imagine part to be a skew-symmetry form \(\omega\), then we have the relation
    $$
    \langle s_1 ,Js_2 \rangle =\omega (s_1 ,s_2);\quad\omega (s_1 ,Js_2)=-\langle s_1 ,s_2\rangle.
    $$
    Therefore when \(\nabla\) is hermitian, then it satisfies the Lebnitz rule for the hermitian inner product \(h\), and conversely, if \(\nabla\) satisfies the given Lebnitz rule for \(h\), by decomposing into real and imagine parts we know that the Lebnitz rule for the real part is also satisfied, and the complex linearity of \(\mathrm{d}\) implies the complex linearity of \(\nabla\).

<h2 class="section" id="adjoint operator">The formal adjoint operator</h2>In this section we show the reason why we impose such a condition on the boundary for the formal adjoint operator given on a manifold with boundary. This depends on a local computation, and the explanation is mainly based on Palais' seminar note [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Pa65">12</a>, Chapter 4]. Recall that for a differentiable manifold \(M\) with boundary \(\partial M\), the local coordinate chart is modeled on the upper half-plane \(\mathbb{R}^n_+\), either lying completely inside this plane or having intersection with the boundary \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). We just do the computation in this model space. Observe that we have

<p><div class="s prp" id="local computation of adjoint operator"></div>Let \(E\to U\) and \(F\to U\) be two hermitian vector bundles over \(U\) with hermitian structures \(h_1\) and \(h_2\), and let \(D\) be a differential operator of order \(k\) from \(E\) to \(F\), then there exists an adjoint operator \(D^{\ast}\colon\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_c (U,F)\to\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_c (U,E)\) to \(D\) such that there exists a sesqui-linear form \(G\) defined on the jet space \(J^{k-1} (E\vert_{\partial U})\) on the boundary \(\partial U\), such that
$$
\int_M h_1( Ds_1 ,s_2) -\int_Mh (s_1 ,D^{\ast} s_2)=\int_{\partial U} G(j^{k-1} s_1 ,j^{k-1} s_2)\mathrm{d}x.
$$</p>

<p>In this case, a differential operator is given by a matrix with values differential operators on \(\mathcal{C}^{\infty } (U)\), the sheaf of smooth functions on \(U\). To be more precise, it has the form
    $$
    D=\sum_{\vert\alpha\vert\leq k} C_{\alpha }D_{\alpha},
    $$
    where \(D_{\alpha}\) is the differential operator given by a composition of partial derivatives with multi-index \(\alpha\), and \(C_{\alpha}\) is a matrix for each \(\alpha\), with values in \(\mathcal{C}^{\infty } (U)\). Since \(U\) is a subspace of some Euclidean space, any vector bundle over \(U\) is trivial, and we can pick hermitian inner products \(\langle -,-\rangle_1\), \(\langle -,-\rangle_2\) on \(E\) and \(F\), respectively, independent of the choice of parameters, then the hermitian structure \(h_i\) can be represented by matrices \(A_i\) with values in \(\mathcal{C}^{\infty } (U)\), i.e. \(\langle -,-\rangle_i =h_i (A_i -,-)\). We set \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\) for the density function on \(U\) and its boundary representing the volume form given on some Riemannian manifold \(M\).
</p>

<p class="proof">This can be done by induction. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#order zero differential operator">We firstly consider the homogeneous first-order differential operator \(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_k}\) where \(1\leq k\leq n\)</a>, then by integration by parts, we have
    $$
    \frac{\partial }{\partial x_k}\langle s_1 ,s_2\rangle_1 =\langle\partial_k s_1 ,s_2\rangle_1 +\langle s_1 ,\partial_k s_2\rangle_1,
    $$
for each \(s_1 ,s_2\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty } (U,E)\). Integrate the above formula over \(U\), we obtain that
$$
\int_U\langle\partial_k s_1 ,s_2\rangle_1\mathrm{d}x -\int_U\langle s_1 ,-\partial_k s_2\rangle_1\mathrm{dx} =\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0,&1\leq k\leq n-1;\\
\int_{\partial U}\langle s_1 ,s_2\rangle_1\mathrm{d}x',&k=n.
\end{array}\right.
$$
Now we consider the general case. Firstly, for general differential operator \(D^{\alpha}\), we have
$$
\int_U\langle D^{\alpha} s_1 ,s_2\rangle_1\mathrm{d}x-\int_U\langle s_1 ,(-1)^{\vert\alpha\vert} D^{\alpha} s_2\rangle_1\mathrm{d} x=\int_{\partial U} G_{\alpha} (j_{k-1} s_1 ,j_{k-1} s_2)\mathrm{d} x',
$$
and when we impose the matrix \(C_{\alpha}\), with the corresponding adjoint operator \(C_{\alpha}'\) which satisfies the condition \(h_2 (C_{\alpha } s_1 ,s_2)=h_1 (s_1 ,C_{\alpha}'s_2)\), we have
$$
h_2 (Ds_1 ,s_2)=\langle B\sum_{\alpha} C_{\alpha} D^{\alpha} s_1 ,s_2\rangle_2 =\sum_{\alpha}\langle D^{\alpha} s_1 ,C_{\alpha}'B(-1)^{\vert\alpha\vert} s_2\rangle_1
$$
and hence via integration, we have(we set (-,-)_i to be the corresponding \(L^2\)-inner product on vector bundles \(E\) and \(F\), respectively.)
$$
(Df,g)_1 -\int_U\langle f,\sum_{\alpha} (-1)^{\vert\alpha\vert} D^{\alpha}(\rho C_{\alpha}' Bg)\rangle_1 =\int_{\partial U} G(j_{k-1} f,\bar{j}_{k-1} g)\mathrm{d}x'.
$$
where \(\bar{j}_{k-1} g=(j_{k-1} (\rho C_{\alpha}'Bg))_{\alpha}\) and \(G\) is the sum of all \(G_{\alpha}\)s. Now we can just define the adjoint operator \(D^{\ast}\) as
$$
D^{\ast} g=\sum_{\alpha} (-1)^{\vert\alpha\vert}\frac{1}{\rho} A^{-1} D^{\alpha} (\rho C_{\alpha}'Bg)=\sum_{\vert\alpha\vert\leq k}\left(\sum_{\alpha\leq\lambda} (-1)^{\vert\lambda\vert}\binom{\lambda}{\alpha}\frac{1}{\rho} A^{-1} D^{\lambda -\alpha} (\rho C_{\lambda}'B)\right)D^{\alpha} g,
$$
and this is just a differential operator of order \(k\) which satisfies the required identity.</p>

<p><div class="s remark"></div>In our case, we are concerning differential operators on a single hermitian vector bundle \(E\to\Sigma\), so when two sections \(s_1 ,s_2\) satisfies \(s_1\perp s_2\) on the boundary, it follows automatically(from the construction of the proof) that the right-hand side concerning integration on the boundary vanishes, hence we have the "true adjointness" for Cauchy-Riemann operators.</p>
