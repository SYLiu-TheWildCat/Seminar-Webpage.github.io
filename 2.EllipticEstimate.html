    <h1>2. Elliptic Estimate</h1>
    <p>Now we are stepping into the proof of theorem <a href="1.Introduction.html#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>. The first preparation work will be the analytical, or the most technical part: the elliptic estimate, which helps us prove the first part of the theorem. We will firstly recall basic materials of partial differential equations and then give local estimates for Cauchy-Riemann operators. Finally we will reach our desired global estimate result and then give a prove of part (i) of theorem <a href="1.Introduction.html#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>. </p>
    
    <h2 class="section" id="PDE">Partial Differential Equations</h2> In this section, we are going to recall basic materials in PDE. Let \(U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n\) be an open region in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), then we have

    <p><div class="s definition"></div>A <b class="textbf">test function</b> on \(U\) is a function \(f\) which is smooth and has compact support. We write \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\) for the space of all test functions on \(U\).</p>

    <p>There is a natural topology on \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\) given by a family of semi-norms \(\{\Vert\cdot\Vert_{K,m}\}\), where
        $$
        \Vert f\Vert_{K,m} =\sup_{x\in K}\sum_{\vert\alpha\vert\leq m}\vert \partial_{\alpha} f(x)\vert,
        $$
        with \(K\subset\subset U\) compact and \(m\) an arbitrary integer. Open subsets of \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\) are generated by sets of the form \(\{f\in C_c^{\infty} (U)\vert\Vert f-g\Vert_{K,m}<\varepsilon\text{ for some }\varepsilon >0\text{ and some } g\in C_c^{\infty} (U)\}\). The total space we are concerning is the dual space of \(C_c^{\infty } (U)\), i.e. the space of continuous linear functionals on \(C_c^{\infty } (U)\) which is continuous with respect to the given topology described above, which is the space of <b class="textbf">distributions</b>, usually denoted by \(\mathcal{D}' (U)\). Distributions are also called <b class="textbf">generalized functions</b>, since they are not necessarily functions, but it turns out that we should include these data to analyse PDEs.</p>
    
        <p>Given a distribution \(\Lambda\in\mathcal{D}' (U)\) and a test function \(\varphi\), we write \(\langle\Lambda ,\varphi\rangle\) for the value \(\Lambda (\varphi )\). We define the derivation \(\partial_{\alpha}\colon\mathcal{D}' (U)\to\mathcal{D}' (U)\) on distributions by "integration by parts", i.e. \(\langle\partial_{\alpha}\Lambda ,\varphi\rangle =\langle\Lambda ,(-1)^{\vert\alpha\vert}\partial_{\alpha}\varphi\rangle\). There is also a \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\)-action on \(\mathcal{D}' (U)\) given by \(\langle f\Lambda ,\varphi\rangle :=\langle\Lambda ,f\varphi\rangle\). </p>

        <p>It is easy to verify that \(C_c^{\infty} (U):=\mathcal{D} (U)\subseteq\mathcal{D}'(U)\) where the linear functional is just given by multiplication and integration over \(U\). We could then obtain locally convex vector spaces that contains \(\mathcal{D} (U)\) but is contained in \(\mathcal{D}' (U)\) by completing semi-norms defining \(\mathcal{D} (U)\). One of the completion is taken with respect to the norm \(\Vert f\Vert_k :=\sup_{x\in U}\vert f(x)\vert\) given above, which would lead to the space of continuous functions \(C^k (U)\). Another way is to complete \(\mathcal{D} (U)\) via the norm \(\Vert f\Vert_{k,p} =\displaystyle\sum_{\vert\alpha\vert\leq k}\left(\int_U\vert D^{\alpha}f(x)\vert^p\diff x\right)^{1/p}\), and in this way we obtain the <b class="textbf">Sobolev space</b> \(W^{k,p} (U)\). It's obvious that we have the relation
        $$
    \mathcal{D} (U)\subseteq\dotsb\subseteq W^{k,p} (U)\subseteq W^{k-1,p} (U)\subseteq\dotsb\subseteq W^{1,p} (U)\subseteq L^p (U)\subseteq W^{-1,p} (U)\subseteq\dotsb\subseteq\mathcal{D}' (U),
$$
where we set \(W^{-k,p} (U)\) to be the dual space of \(W^{k,p} (U)\), i.e. the space of continuous linear functionals on \(W^{k,p} (U)\) endowed with weak-\(\ast\) toplogy. Viewed as distributions, we have naturally the action of derivations and multiplication by test functions.</p>

<p>In the above paragraph, we have introduced the space \(C^k\) of all differentiable functions of order up to \(k\), and it is easy to generlize to the space of differentiable functions of fractional order. This is the "Hölder continuous" we met in analysis courses, and the formal definition is given below.</p>

<p><div class="s definition"></div>A function \(f\in C^0 (U)\) is called <b class="textbf">Hölder continuous</b> of order \(0\leq\alpha < 1\) if the supremum
$$
\sup_{x,y\in U, x\neq y}\frac{\vert f(x)-f(y)\vert}{\vert x-y\vert^{\alpha}}<\infty.
$$
We say a function is Hölder continuous of order \(k\leq\beta < k+1 \) if \(D^{\alpha} f\) is Hölder continuous of order \(\beta -k\) for all \(\vert\alpha\vert =k\). </p>

<p>The basic structure of Sobolev spaces are contained in the following theorem, called "Sobolev embedding theorem". This is done by several mathematicians, and a proof can be found in Chapter 5 of the famous textbook [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ev10">5</a>].</p>

<p><div class="s theorem">(Sobolev)</div>Let \(U\) be a bounded domain in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying local Lipschitz conditions(which can be always achieved on manifolds), \(k\) be a positive integer and \(1< p\leq\infty \) a real number that can be chosen to be infinity. Then we have the following
<ol class="thm">
    <li>If \(kp>n\), then we have \(W^{k,p} (U)\hookrightarrow C^{\alpha } (\overline{U})\) where \(0\le \alpha\le\frac{kp-n}{p}\), and we can achieve \(\alpha =\frac{kp-n}{p}\) once this fraction is not an integer. </li>
    <li>If \(kp< n\), then we have \(W^{k,p} (U)\hookrightarrow L^q (U)\) for \(p\leq q\leq p^{\ast} =\frac{np}{n-kp}\).</li>
    <li>If \(kp=n\), then we have \(W^{k,p} (U)\hookrightarrow L^q (U)\) for all \(q\geq p\).</li>
</ol></p>

<p><div class="s theorem">(Rellich-Kondrachov)</div>Let \(U,k,p\) be as defined in the above theorem, then 
<ol class="thm">
    <li>For \(kp\leq n\), the embedding \(W^{k,p} (U)\hookrightarrow L^q (U)\) is compact for \(q<\frac{np}{n-kp}\) or \(q<\infty\) when equality is achieved.</li>
    <li>For \(kp> n\), the embedding \(W^{k,p} (U)\hookrightarrow C^{\alpha} (U)\) is compact for all \(\alpha< k-\frac{n}{p}\).</li>
</ol></p>

<p>These two results are fundamental in the modern theory of partial differential equations. A restricted proof can be found in [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ev10">5</a>]. Another important result that we would use is the following boundary estimate.</p>

<p><div class="s theorem">(Trace Theorem)</div>Let \(\Omega\) a domain in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with good boundary property, and suppose there exists an \(m,p\)-extension operator \(E\) for \(\Omega\). Let \(m\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\) and \(p>1\) be positive numbers such that \(mp< 2\), and \(p\leq q\leq\frac{(n-1)p}{n-mp}\), then we have the embedding
$$
W^{m,p} (\Omega )\hookrightarrow L^q (\Omega ).
$$
If \(mp=n\), we can choose \(q\) to be an arbitrary positive real number \(\geq p\).</p>

<h2 class="section" id="elliptic-estimate-CR">Elliptic Estimates for Cauchy-Riemann Operators</h2> Now we are going to develop regularity results for Cauchy-Riemann operators over a Riemann surface. Since we are concerning compact Riemann surfaces with boundaries, the local model will be \((U,z)\) where \(U\subseteq\mathbb{H}\) is an open subset of the upper half-plane \(\mathbb{H}\), and the Cauchy-Riemann operator \(D\) has the form \(\bar{\partial} +A\) where \(A\) is just a differential \(1\)-form with values endomorphisms. Since locally the bundle \(E\) and the bundle of differential forms are trivial, we can just view these sections as vector-valued functions over \(E\) with the trivial boundary condition. The statement then reduces to local estimates for the operator \(L\) which is an operator defined on some vector-valued functions \(u\colon U\to\mathbb{R}^{2n}\). We firstly consider the operator \(\bar{\partial}\).

<p><div class="s prp"></div>Let \(u\) be a smooth function defined on \(U\subseteq\mathbb{H}\) satisfying the boundary condition \(u(\mathbb{R}\times\{0\} )\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n\times\{0\}\), then there exists an open subset \(V\subset\subset U\) and a positive constant \(C>0\) such that
$$
\Vert u\Vert_{W^{1,p} (V)}\subseteq C(\Vert\bar{\partial} u\Vert_{L^p (U)} +\Vert u\Vert_{L^p (U)}). 
$$</p>

<p>Recall that in local coordinates, we have \(\bar{\partial } =\partial_s +J\partial_t\) where \(J\) is the almost complex structure, and \(\partial =\partial_s +J\partial_t\). In this case we can pick unitary frame so that the almost complex structure \(J\) is standard, i.e. we have \(\nabla J=0\). Then if we write \(f=\bar{\partial } u\), by an easy calculation, we obtain that
    $$
    \Delta u=\partial f. 
    $$
    This is our starting point of the elliptic estimate. 
</p>

<p><div class="s theorem" id="laplacian-estimate"></div>Let \(u\in L_{loc}^p (U)\) and \(f,g,h\in L^p (U)\) satisfies the identity
$$
\Delta u=f+\nabla_s g+\nabla_t h
$$
in the distribution sense. Then there exists an open subset \(V\subset\subset U\) and a positive constant \(C>0\) such that
$$
\Vert u\Vert_{W^{1,p} (V)}\leq C(\Vert u\Vert_{L^p (U)} +\Vert f\Vert_{L^p (U)} +\Vert g\Vert_{L^p (U)} +\Vert h\Vert_{L^p (U)} ). 
$$
In other words, \(u\in L^p (U)\) implies that \(u\in W^{1,p} (V)\) for this \(V\subseteq U\).</p>

<p>The proof can be found in Audin's book [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Au14">8</a>] or my thesis [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Li20">14</a>]. This result directly implies the elliptic regularity for the Cauchy-Riemann operator \(\bar{\partial}\) locally. We would then wonder if we could glue them together to obtain global estimates. This is our next result.</p>

<p><div class="s theorem"></div>Let \((\Sigma, j,\dvol )\) be a compact Riemann surface with boundary, and \(D\) is a smooth complex-linear Cauchy-Riemann operator on the complex vector bundle \(E\to\Sigma\). Then there exists a positive constant \(C>0\) such that for any \(u\in L^p_{loc} (\Sigma)\),
$$
\Vert u\Vert_{W^{1,p} (\Sigma )}\leq C(\Vert\bar{\partial } u\Vert_{L^p (\Sigma)} +\Vert u\Vert_{L^p (\Sigma)}). 
$$
</p>

<p class="proof">We just apply theorem <a href="#laplacian-estimate">2.6</a>. For each \(x\in\Sigma\), we can pick an open neighbourhood \(U_x\) and an open subset \(V_x\) such that \(x\in V_x\) and the estimate in theorem <a href="#laplacian-estimate">2.6</a> holds in \(U_x\). However, in this case, \(D=\bar{\partial } +A\) for some matrix \(A\), but it is smooth, so we have \(\Vert\bar{\partial } u\Vert_{L^p (U_x )}\leq\Vert Du\Vert_{L^p (U_x )} +\Vert Au\Vert_{L^p (U_x )}\) and hence the same estimate holds also for \(D\). Since \(\Sigma\) is compact, it is covered by only finitely many pairs \(\{(U_i ,V_i)\}\) with \(\bigcup V_i =\Sigma\), and we have the estimates for each \(V_i\), hence
$$
\Vert u\Vert_{W^{1,p} (\Sigma )}^p =\sum\Vert u\Vert_{W^{1,p} (V_i)}^p\leq \sum C_i (\Vert Du\Vert_{L^p (U_i)} +\Vert u\Vert_{L^p (U_i)})\leq C(\Vert Du\Vert_{L^p (\Sigma)} +\Vert u\Vert_{L^p (\Sigma)}. 
$$
&nbsp</p>

<p>Note that the general case does not follow directly from our preceding proof since we do not have \(fu\in L^p (U)\) if \(f,u\in L^p (U)\). So let's investigate what happens to this zero-order differential operator \(A\).</p>

<p><div class="s prp"></div>Let \(\ell p>2\) where \(\ell\) is a positive integer and \(p>1\) a positive real number. Let \(k\leq\ell\) be another positive real number and \(q>1\) such that \(k-\frac{2}{q}\leq\ell -\frac{2}{p}\). Let \( A\in W^{\ell-1 ,p} (\Sigma ,T^{\ast }\Sigma\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\End_{\mathbb{R}} (E))\) be a differential \(1\)-form with values in \(\End_{\mathbb{R} } (E)\), then \(A\) can be viewed as a compact linear operator
$$
W^{k,q} (\Sigma ,E)\to W^{k-1,q} (\Sigma ,T^{0,1}\Sigma\otimes E)\colon\xi\mapsto (A\xi )^{0,1}.
$$</p>

<p class="proof">We apply the Sobolev embedding theorem. If \(k=\ell\) then \(q\leq p\), and by Hölder's inequality, \(W^{\ell -1,p}\hookrightarrow W^{k-1,q}\). Since the map \(W^{1,p} (K)\to L^p (K)\) given by multiplying a \(L^p\)-function is well-defined(from the Sobolev embedding theorem, the Hölder's inequality, and the assumption that \(K\) be compact), the first statement holds for \(k=\ell\). For \(k\leq\ell-2\), the relation \(k-\frac{2}{q}\leq\ell -\frac{2}{p}\) tells us that we have the embedding \(W^{\ell -1,q} (\Sigma ,T^{\ast }\Sigma\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\End_{\mathbb{R} } (E))\hookrightarrow C^{k-1} (\Sigma ,T^{\ast }\Sigma\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\End_{\mathbb{R} } (E))\), and the result follows directly. For \(k=\ell-1\), we have \(\frac{2}{p}\leq 1+\frac{2}{q}\Rightarrow q\leq\frac{2p}{2-p}\), hence from Sobolev embedding theorem, we have \(W^{\ell -1,p} (\Sigma ,T^{\ast }\Sigma\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\End_{\mathbb{R} } (E))\hookrightarrow W^{k-1,q} (\Sigma ,T^{\ast}\Sigma\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\End_{\mathbb{R}} (E))\), which gives the required result.</br></br>
    Now for the compactness, we just apply the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem. If \(kq>2\) and \(q>2\) then we have the compact embedding \(W^{k,q}\hookrightarrow C^{k-1}\) and hence the operator is obviously compact. If \(q\leq 2\), then we only have compact embeddings \(W^{k,q}\hookrightarrow W^{k-1,r}\) for any \(q\leq r< \frac{2q}{2-q}\), but since \(\Sigma\) is compact, some of them embeds into \(W^{k-1,q'} \) where \(q'\) is conjugate to \(q\), and the compactness follows.</br></br>
    If \(kq\leq 2\), then we must have \(k=1\) and \(q\leq 2\). In this case, we just use the Rellich embedding for \(W^{1,q}\hookrightarrow L^r\) for any \(q\leq r<\frac{2q}{2-q}\), and since \(q\leq 2\), it follows that \(W^{1,q}\hookrightarrow L^{q'}\) is compact where \(q'\) is conjugate to \(q\), therefore in any cases, this operator is compact(and hence bounded). 
</p>

<p>The main estimate for this subsection is the following</p>

<p><div class="s theorem"></div>Let \(D_F\) be a real linear Cauchy-Riemann operator of class \(W^{\ell -1,p}\) where \(\ell p>2\), and \(D_F^{\ast}\) its corresponding dual operator, then for \(0< k\leq\ell\) an integer and \(q,r\in\mathbb{R}_+\) such that \(\frac{2}{r} -1\leq k-\frac{2}{q}\leq\ell -\frac{2}{p}\), we have \(D_F\) and \(D_F^{\ast}\) Fredholm viewed as an operator \(W^{k,q}_F (\Sigma ,E)\to W^{k-1,q} (\Sigma ,E\otimes T^{0,1} E)\), and the Fredholm index satisfies \(\Ind (D_F )+\Ind (D_F^{\ast} )=0\). This is independent of the choice of almost complex structures on \(\Sigma\) and the indices \(k,q\). Moreover, we have
<ol class="thm">
