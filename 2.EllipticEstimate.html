    <h1>2. Elliptic Estimate</h1>
    <p>Now we are stepping into the proof of theorem <a href="1.Introduction.html#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>. The first preparation work will be the analytical, or the most technical part: the elliptic estimate, which helps us prove the first part of the theorem. We will firstly recall basic materials of partial differential equations and then give local estimates for Cauchy-Riemann operators. Finally we will reach our desired global estimate result and then give a prove of part (i) of theorem <a href="1.Introduction.html#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>. </p>
    
    <h2 class="section" id="PDE">Partial Differential Equations</h2> In this section, we are going to recall basic materials in PDE. Let \(U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n\) be an open region in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), then we have

    <p><div class="s definition"></div>A <b class="textbf">test function</b> on \(U\) is a function \(f\) which is smooth and has compact support. We write \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\) for the space of all test functions on \(U\).</p>

    <p>There is a natural topology on \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\) given by a family of semi-norms \(\{\Vert\cdot\Vert_{K,m}\}\), where
        $$
        \Vert f\Vert_{K,m} =\sup_{x\in K}\sum_{\vert\alpha\vert\leq m}\vert \partial_{\alpha} f(x)\vert,
        $$
        with \(K\subset\subset U\) compact and \(m\) an arbitrary integer. Open subsets of \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\) are generated by sets of the form \(\{f\in C_c^{\infty} (U)\vert\Vert f-g\Vert_{K,m}<\varepsilon\text{ for some }\varepsilon >0\text{ and some } g\in C_c^{\infty} (U)\}\). The total space we are concerning is the dual space of \(C_c^{\infty } (U)\), i.e. the space of continuous linear functionals on \(C_c^{\infty } (U)\) which is continuous with respect to the given topology described above, which is the space of <b class="textbf">distributions</b>, usually denoted by \(\mathcal{D}' (U)\). Distributions are also called <b class="textbf">generalized functions</b>, since they are not necessarily functions, but it turns out that we should include these data to analyse PDEs.</p>
    
        <p>Given a distribution \(\Lambda\in\mathcal{D}' (U)\) and a test function \(\varphi\), we write \(\langle\Lambda ,\varphi\rangle\) for the value \(\Lambda (\varphi )\). We define the derivation \(\partial_{\alpha}\colon\mathcal{D}' (U)\to\mathcal{D}' (U)\) on distributions by "integration by parts", i.e. \(\langle\partial_{\alpha}\Lambda ,\varphi\rangle =\langle\Lambda ,(-1)^{\vert\alpha\vert}\partial_{\alpha}\varphi\rangle\). There is also a \(C_c^{\infty} (U)\)-action on \(\mathcal{D}' (U)\) given by \(\langle f\Lambda ,\varphi\rangle :=\langle\Lambda ,f\varphi\rangle\). </p>

        <p>It is easy to verify that \(C_c^{\infty} (U):=\mathcal{D} (U)\subseteq\mathcal{D}'(U)\) where the linear functional is just given by multiplication and integration over \(U\). We could then obtain locally convex vector spaces that contains \(\mathcal{D} (U)\) but is contained in \(\mathcal{D}' (U)\) by completing semi-norms defining \(\mathcal{D} (U)\). One of the completion is taken with respect to the norm \(\Vert f\Vert_k :=\sup_{x\in U}\vert f(x)\vert\) given above, which would lead to the space of continuous functions \(C^k (U)\). Another way is to complete \(\mathcal{D} (U)\) via the norm \(\Vert f\Vert_{k,p} =\displaystyle\sum_{\vert\alpha\vert\leq k}\left(\int_U\vert D^{\alpha}f(x)\vert^p\diff x\right)^{1/p}\), and in this way we obtain the <b class="textbf">Sobolev space</b> \(W^{k,p} (U)\). It's obvious that we have the relation
        $$
    \mathcal{D} (U)\subseteq\dotsb\subseteq W^{k,p} (U)\subseteq W^{k-1,p} (U)\subseteq\dotsb\subseteq W^{1,p} (U)\subseteq L^p (U)\subseteq W^{-1,p} (U)\subseteq\dotsb\subseteq\mathcal{D}' (U),
$$
where we set \(W^{-k,p} (U)\) to be the dual space of \(W^{k,p} (U)\), i.e. the space of continuous linear functionals on \(W^{k,p} (U)\) endowed with weak-\(\ast\) toplogy. Viewed as distributions, we have naturally the action of derivations and multiplication by test functions.</p>
