        <h1>&#8546. The Maslov Index and Chern-Weil Theory.</h1>
        <p>In the previous series of talks we have proved the first part of Riemann-Roch theorem <a href="1.Introduction.html#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>, and in this series we aim to introduce the concept of boundary Maslov index, which serves as the Fredholm index stated in this theorem. Then we will try to give a proof of the second part of Riemann-Roch theorem using properties of Maslov index and Morse theory.</p>

        <h2 class="section" id="boundary-Maslov-index">The Boundary Maslov Index</h2> We start with an exposition of the classical Maslov index. It is originally studied by Maslov and then developed by Arnold in his paper [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ar67">15</a>] where they used it to give another conditions for quantizations. In their setting, let $(V,\omega )$ be a symplectic vector space of dimension $2n$ where $\omega$ is some symplectic form, and we are considering the space $\mathcal{L} (V)$ of all Lagrangian subspace of $V$. This space is called the <b class="textbf">Lagrangian Grassmannian</b> of $V$. On the complex side, given a complex vector space $(W,
        J)$ where $J$ is the complex structure, we have the space $\mathcal{R} (W)$ of all totally real subspaces of $W$. With a group-theoretic point of view, we know that they are all homogeneous spaces: $\mathcal{L} (V)=\mathrm{Sp} (V)/\mathrm{GL} (n,\mathbb{R})$, and $\mathcal{R} (W)=\mathrm{GL} (W,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{GL} (n,\mathbb{R})$. The Maslov index gives a map
        $$
        \Pi_1 (\mathcal{L} (V))\rightarrow\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{2},
        $$
        that is, associated to any path $\gamma$ in $\mathcal{L} (V)$ a half-integer $\mu (\gamma) $. When we are considering loops in this Lagrangian Grassmannian, we would get an integer, which by Arnold comes from the pairing of the homology class $\gamma\in H_1 (\mathcal{L} (V),\mathbb{Z})$ with some cohomology class $\mu\in H^1 (\mathcal{L} (V),\mathbb{Z})$. This class $\mu$ is called the <b class="textbf">Maslov class</b> and the pairing $\mu (\gamma)$ is called the <b class="textbf">Maslov index</b> of $\gamma$. Recall that a symplectic space $V$ admits naturally a compactible complex structure $J$ so that the space becomes a complex vector space, hence we can talk about both $\mathcal{R} (n)$ and $\mathcal{L} (n)$ on $V$.
        <p><div class="s lemma"></div>$\mathcal{L} (V)$ is a deformation retract of $\mathcal{R} (V)$. There exists a map $\det^2\colon\mathcal{L} (V)\to\mathbb{S}^1$ such that its induced map $\det_{\ast}^2$ on $H_1 $ is an isomorphism and this coincides with the Maslov index $\mu$.</p>
        <p class="proof">You could find it in [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Li20">14</a>].</p>

        <p>With this map $\det^2$, we could then consider the similar invariant on the space $\mathcal{R} (V)$. The map $\det^2$ here is a group homomorphism $\det^2\colon\mathcal{R} (V)\to\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$, hence inducing a map on first homology group $\det_{\ast}^2\colon H_1 (\mathcal{R} (V))\to\mathbb{Z}$. They will give the same invariant by this lemma, and in this case we just drop the symplectic form and consider the space $\mathcal{R} (V)$. So we have the following Corollary:</p>

        <p><div class="s crl"></div>Any two loops in $\mathcal{R} (n)$ and $\mathcal{L} (n)$ are homotopic if and only if they have the same Maslov index.</p>

        <p>Now we are going to construct boundary Maslov index of the bundle pair $(E,F)$ over the compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with boundary $\partial\Sigma$. Since $\Sigma$ is two-dimensional, its boundary is a one-dimensional closed manifold and is hence a disjoint union of circles. Therefore a totally real subbundle $F\subseteq E\vert_{\partial\Sigma}$ on the boundary is a map $\Lambda\colon\partial\Sigma\to\mathcal{R} (n)$,and we could talk about the Maslov index $\mu (\Lambda)$. It turns out that this index nearly completely characterized bundle pairs.</p>

        <p><div class="s definition"></div>Two bundle pairs $(E_1 ,F_1)$ and $(E_2 ,F_2)$ are <b class="textbf">isomorphic</b> if there exists a complex-linear bundle isomorphism $\Phi\colon E_1\to E_2$ such that $\Phi (F_1)=F_2$.</p>

        <p>In this sense of isomorphism, we have the following characterization:</p>

        <p><div class="s theorem"></div>There is a unique map $\mu$ from the space of all bundle pairs over a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ such that the following axioms are satisfied:<br>
            <ul class="thm">
                <li><div class="scap">(Isomorphism)</div> Let $\Phi\colon E_1\to E_2$ be an isomorphism of complex vector bundles covering an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism $\phi\colon\Sigma_1\to\Sigma_2$ of compact Riemann surfaces with boundary, and let $F_1\subseteq E_1\vert_{\partial\Sigma_1}$ be a totally real subbundle, then we have $\mu (E_1 ,F_1)=\mu (E_2 ,\Phi (F_1))$. </li>
                <li><div class="scap">(Direct Sum)</div> Let $(E_1 ,F_1)$ and $(E_2 ,F_2)$ be two bundle pairs over the same compcat Riemann surface $\Sigma$, then we have $\mu (E_1 ,F_1 )+\mu (E_2,F_2)=\mu (E_1\oplus E_2 ,F_1\oplus F_2)$. </li>
<li><div class="scap">(Composition)</div> Let $\Sigma_{02} =\Sigma_{01}\cup\Sigma_{12}$ be a composition of cobordisms(we will introduce this concept in the sequel), and let $(E_{ij} ,F_{ij})$ be the corresponding bundle pairs, then $\mu (E_{01} ,F_{01} )+\mu (E_{12} ,F_{12} )=\mu (E_{02} ,F_{02} )$.</li>
<li><div class="scap">(Normalization)</div> If $\Sigma =\mathbb{D}$ is the closed unit disk with boundary $\mathbb{S}^1$, and $E=\mathbb{D}\times\mathbb{C}$ the trivial line bundle with totally real subbundle given by $F_z=\mathbb{R} e^{ik\theta /2}$ for $z=e^{i\theta}\in\mathbb{S}^1$, then\[
    \mu (D\times\mathbb{C} ,F)=k.\]</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>And the boundary Maslov index has the following important property that would be used in our proof:</p>

        <p><div class="s prp"></div>The boundary Maslov index satisfies the following:
        <ul class="thm">
            <li><div class="scap">(Trivial Bundle)</div>If $\partial\Sigma\neq\emptyset$ and $E=\Sigma\times\mathbb{C}^n$, then \[
            \mu (\Sigma\times\mathbb{C}^n,F)=\mu(\Lambda)
        \]
    where $\Lambda$ is defined by $\Lambda (z)=F_z$ for $z\in\partial\Sigma$.</li>
    <li><div class="scap">(Chern Class)</div>If $\partial\Sigma =\emptyset$, then $\mu (E,\emptyset )$ is twice the value of the first Chern class $c_1 (E)\in H^2 (\Sigma)$ on the fundamental class $[\Sigma]\in H_2 (\Sigma)$:
    \[
\mu (E,\emptyset )=2\langle c_1 (E),[\Sigma ]\rangle.
\]</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>We want to prove these theorems. First of all, note that compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with boundary $\partial\Sigma$ has the homotopy type of a bunch of circles, so we could guess any bundle pair $(E,F)$ over $\Sigma$ would have nice classification results. In fact, for real vector bundles over a circle, it is well-known that there are only two types of them, classified only by orientation, hence for $F$, there exists $(n-1)$ everywhere linearly independent sections $s_1 ,\dotsb ,s_{n-1}$ and a line bundle $L\to\partial\Sigma$ such that \[
            F=L\oplus\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1}\mathbb{R} s_i.
            \]
            We call this a <b class="textbf">partial framing</b> of $F$.
        </p>

        <p><div class="s prp"></div>Let $(E,F)$ be a bundle pair over $\Sigma$ equipped with a partial framing $(L;s_1 ,\dotsb, s_{n-1})$ on $F$, then there exists a global trivialization $\Phi\colon E\to\Sigma\times\mathbb{C}^n$ such that $\Phi (s_i) =e_i$ and $\Phi (L)=\sqrt{\lambda (z)}\mathbb{R}$ where $\lambda\colon\partial\Sigma\to\mathbb{S}^1$ is a smooth function and $\{e_i\}$ is the set of coordinate functions on $\mathbb{C}^n$. </p>

        <p class="proof">See my thesis [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Li20">14</a>].</p>

        <p><div class="s crl"></div>Let $(E,F)$ be a rank one bundle pair on $\mathbb{D}$, then there exists a trivialization $\Phi\colon E\to\mathbb{D}\times\mathbb{C} $ such that $\Phi (F_z)=\mathbb{R} e^{ik\theta /2}$ where $z=e^{i\theta}\in\mathbb{S}^1$. </p>

        <p>To proceed the proof, we need a technique called "pair-of-pants induction". This is a result of classifying compact Riemann surfaces with boundary in the topological sense, via Morse theory.</p>

        <h2 class="section" id="pair-of-pants-induction">Pair-of-Pants Induction</h2> Let $\Sigma$ be a compact surface with boundary. Here we do not impose the complex structure(or hermitian structure) on $\Sigma$, and we aim to apply Morse theory to compact surfaces in order to give the pair-of-pants induction.

        <p><div class="s definition"></div>Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold. A <b class="textbf">Morse function</b> $f\colon M\to\mathbb{R} $ is a smooth function on $M$ such that for each point $x\in M$ such that $\diff f_x=0$, we have $\diff^2_x f$ is a non-degenerate bilinear form.(Note that this form is always symmetric, and the proof can be seen in Lang's famous textbook [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#La95">16</a>].)</p>

        <p>Morse function was firstly introduced by Morse in 1939 when he was trying to compute the dimension of the subspace of the tangent space of the space of all loops connecting two points such that the Hessian at this point of the energy functional is negative definite. Then we found that the critical points of any Morse function has topological meanings: critical points together with its <b class="textbf">Morse index</b> gives cellular decompositions of $M$, and Witten in 1982 found furthermore that Morse function gives homology theories on $M$: we can set $CM_{\ast} (M,f;\mathbb{Z}_2)$ to be the vector space generated by critical points of $f$, and let $\partial\colon CM_{k+1} (M,f;\mathbb{Z}_2)\to CM_k (M,f;\mathbb{Z}_2)$ be the map counting trajectories starting from the given critical points and end at some critical points of index one less. Then it can be shown that this actually gives the boundary map satisfying $\partial^2=0$. Then we would obtain the corresponding homology group $HM_{\ast} (M,f;\mathbb{Z}_2 )$, which is called the <b class="textbf">Morse homology</b>. It turns out that this homology group is independent of the choice of Morse functions, and this group is isomorphic to the singular homology group $H_{\ast} (M;\mathbb{Z}_2)$. We can even impose orientations to the counting of trajectories so that we can talk about coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>

        <p><div class="s lemma">(Morse)</div>Let $p$ be a non-degenerate critical point of $f$, then there exists an open neighbourhood $U_p$ of $p$ and a diffeomorphism $\varphi\colon U_p\to\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $\varphi (p)=0$ and $f\circ\varphi^{-1} (x)=f(p)-x_1^2 -\dotsb -x_i^2 -+x_{i+1}^2+\dotsb +x_m^2$.</p>
        
        <p>We call the integer $i$ the Morse index of $f$ and written $\Ind_p (f)$. This lemma tells us that the non-degenerate critical points of any smooth functions are isolated, hence when $M$ is compact, there are only finitely many of them. The reason why the critical points play an important role is the following:</p>

        <p><div class="s prp"></div>Let $f$ be a smooth function on $M$ and $a\in\mathbb{R}$ is in the image of $f$. Then if $a$ is a regular value, we have a diffeomorphism $f^{-1} (-\infty, a-\varepsilon ]\cong f^{-1} (-\infty ,a+\varepsilon ]$; if $a$ is a critical value, $f^{-1} (-\infty ,a+\varepsilon ]$ is diffeotopic to $f^{-1} (-\infty ,a-\varepsilon ]$ attaching a cell of index $\Ind_p (f)$ where $p$ is the critical point of $f$ such that $f(p)=a$.</p>

        <p>This characterization of sublevel set is essential in our discussion. Now we introduce an application of the Morse theory, given also in Milnor's famous book [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Mi65">18</a>]. We start with a topological definition.</p>

        <p><div class="s definition"></div>Let $M,N$ be two closed manifold of dimension $n$. A <b class="textbf">cobordism</b> from $M$ to $N$ is a compact manifold $C\colon M\Rightarrow N$ with boundary $\partial C=M\coprod\bar{N}$, where $\bar{N}$ is $N$ with the orientation reversed.</p>

        <img src="cobordism.png" alt="The Cobordism Between Two Manifolds" style="width: 400px;height: 200px;" class="center">

        <p>Cobordism can be studied via Morse theory. In this context, for a differentiable manifold $W$ with boudnary, we require a Morse function $f$ on $W$ to satisfy a further property that the value of $f$ on a connected component of $\partial W$ is the same, and there are no critical points on the boundary, so our basic results stated above still holds in this context.</p>
