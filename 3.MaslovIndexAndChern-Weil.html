        <h1>&#8546. The Maslov Index and Chern-Weil Theory.</h1>
        <p>In the previous series of talks we have proved the first part of Riemann-Roch theorem <a href="1.Introduction.html#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>, and in this series we aim to introduce the concept of boundary Maslov index, which serves as the Fredholm index stated in this theorem. Then we will try to give a proof of the second part of Riemann-Roch theorem using properties of Maslov index and Morse theory.</p>

        <h2 class="section" id="boundary-Maslov-index">The Boundary Maslov Index</h2> We start with an exposition of the classical Maslov index. It is originally studied by Maslov and then developed by Arnold in his paper [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ar67">15</a>] where they used it to give another conditions for quantizations. In their setting, let \((V,\omega )\) be a symplectic vector space of dimension \(2n\) where \(\omega\) is some symplectic form, and we are considering the space \(\mathcal{L} (V)\) of all Lagrangian subspace of \(V\). This space is called the <b class="textbf">Lagrangian Grassmannian</b> of \(V\). On the complex side, given a complex vector space \((W,
        J)\) where \(J\) is the complex structure, we have the space \(\mathcal{R} (W)\) of all totally real subspaces of \(W\). With a group-theoretic point of view, we know that they are all homogeneous spaces: \(\mathcal{L} (V)=\mathrm{Sp} (V)/\mathrm{GL} (n,\mathbb{R})\), and \(\mathcal{R} (W)=\mathrm{GL} (W,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{GL} (n,\mathbb{R})\). The Maslov index gives a map
        $$
        \Pi_1 (\mathcal{L} (V))\rightarrow\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{2},
        $$
        that is, associated to any path \(\gamma\) in \(\mathcal{L} (V)\) a half-integer \(\mu (\gamma) \). When we are considering loops in this Lagrangian Grassmannian, we would get an integer, which by Arnold comes from the pairing of the homology class \(\gamma\in H_1 (\mathcal{L} (V),\mathbb{Z})\) with some cohomology class \(\mu\in H^1 (\mathcal{L} (V),\mathbb{Z})\). This class \(\mu\) is called the <b class="textbf">Maslov class</b> and the pairing \(\mu (\gamma)\) is called the <b class="textbf">Maslov index</b> of \(\gamma\). Recall that a symplectic space \(V\) admits naturally a compactible complex structure \(J\) so that the space becomes a complex vector space, hence we can talk about both \(\mathcal{R} (n)\) and \(\mathcal{L} (n)\) on \(V\).
        <p><div class="s lemma"></div>\(\mathcal{L} (V)\) is a deformation retract of \(\mathcal{R} (V)\). There exists a map \(\det^2\colon\mathcal{L} (V)\to\mathbb{S}^1\) such that its induced map \(\det_{\ast}^2\) on \(H_1 \) is an isomorphism and this coincides with the Maslov index \(\mu\).</p>
        <p class="proof">You could find it in [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Li20">14</a>].</p>

        <p>With this map \(\det^2\), we could then consider the similar invariant on the space \(\mathcal{R} (V)\). The map \(\det^2\) here is a group homomorphism \(\det^2\colon\mathcal{R} (V)\to\mathbb{C}^{\ast}\), hence inducing a map on first homology group \(\det_{\ast}^2\colon H_1 (\mathcal{R} (V))\to\mathbb{Z}\). They will give the same invariant by this lemma, and in this case we just drop the symplectic form and consider the space \(\mathcal{R} (V)\). So we have the following Corollary:</p>

        <p><div class="s crl"></div>Any two loops in \(\mathcal{R} (n)\) and \(\mathcal{L} (n)\) are homotopic if and only if they have the same Maslov index.</p>
