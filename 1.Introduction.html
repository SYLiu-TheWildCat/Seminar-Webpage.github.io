    <h1>1. Introduction.</h1>
    <p>In this chapter, we are going to give introductions to the Riemann-Roch theorem. This would be divided into two parts. The first part is a brief survey to the classical version of Riemann-Roch theorem without a rigorous proof, and the second part is an introduction to the main motivation for us to develop such a modified version of Riemann-Roch theorem. This comes from Floer theory, where we need to determine the dimension of spaces of solutions to certain non-linear partial differential equations. The second part would also includes no proofs since there would be a long way to go. But I will present some references so interested audiences can refer to them for more details.</p>
    
    <p id="1a"><h2 class="section">1a) Classical Version of Riemann-Roch Theorem</h2>Let \((X,j)\) be a Riemann surface with almost complex structure \(j\). Let \(\mathcal{O}_X\) be the sheaf of holomorphic functions on \(X\), and \(\mathcal{O}_X^{\ast }\) the sheaf of everywhere non-zero holomorphic functions on \(X\), then we have the following exponential sequence:
    $$
        1\to \underline{2\pi i\mathbb{Z}}\to\mathcal{O}_X\xrightarrow{\exp}\mathcal{O}_X^{\ast }\to 1.
    $$
One can prove that on each connected open subset \(U\subseteq X\) the corresponding group \(\mathcal{O}_X (U)\) is an integral domain, hence we can consider the corresponding ring of fractions \(\mathcal{M}_X\) and the multiplicative group \(\mathcal{M}_X^{\ast }\). There is an obvious inclusion \(\mathcal{O}_X^{\ast }\hookrightarrow\mathcal{M}_X\).</p>

    <p id="1.1"><div class="s definition"></div> A <b class="textbf">divisor</b> on \(X\) is a global section of the quotient sheaf \(\mathcal{M}_X^{\ast}/\mathcal{O}_X^{\ast}\). That is, a divisor \(D\) can be written of the form \(D=\displaystyle\sum_{p\in\Sigma}n_p p\), where \(n_p\in\mathbb{Z}\) and \(n_p\neq 0\) for a discrete set of points \(p\).</p>

    <p>We write \(\mathcal{Div}_X\) for the sheaf of divisors on \(X\). Intuitively, a divisor can be understood as equivalent classes of local meromorphic functions modulo everywhere non-zero holomorphic functions, and the integer \(n_p\) at each point \(p\in X\) denotes the number of zeros (if it is negative, then it is the number of poles) of some local meromorphic function.(Observe that multiplication by an invertible holomorphic function does not change this number). Then on global sections, we have the following exact sequence
        $$
            0\to\Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X^{\ast } )\to\Gamma (X,\mathcal{M}_X^{\ast} )\to\mathrm{Div} (X)\to\mathrm{Pic} (X).
        $$
        Here \(\mathrm{Pic} (X)\) is the <b class="textbf">Picard group</b> of \(X\), defined as the equivalence classes of all line bundles, or invertible analytic sheaves over \(X\). Observe that this coincides with the first Čech cohomology \(\check{H}^1 (X,\mathcal{O}_X^{\ast })\), which arises in the prescribed position of the above exact sequence. The kernel of the natural map \(\mathrm{Div} (X)\to\mathrm{Pic} (X)\), by exactness, has kernel generated by \(\displaystyle\left\{D\middle\vert\text{There exists a meromorphic function } f\in\Gamma (X,\mathcal{M}_X^{\ast})\text{ with } (f)=D\right\} \). The divisor \((f)\) is just the image of the third arrow in the above sequence.
    </p>

    <p>Now we give explicit construction of the two maps mentioned above. For a given divisor \(D\), we can assign a locally free sheaf
        $$
        \mathcal{O}_X (D)\colon U\mapsto\{f\in\mathcal{M}_X (U)\vert (f)+D\geq 0\},
        $$
        where \((f)\) is the image of \(\mathcal{M}_X(U)\) that sends any point \(p\) to the formal element \(n_pp\), where \(n_p\) is the order of zeros of \(f\) at \(p\)(and if this number is negative, it is minus the order of poles of \(f\)). It can be easily verified that
    </p>

    <p id="1.2"><div class="s lemma"></div>Two sheaves \(\mathcal{O}_X (D)\) and \(\mathcal{O}_X (E)\) are isomorphic if and only if \(D\sim E\), i.e. the two divisors represent the same equivalent classes in the Picard group \(\mathcal{Pic} (X)\).</p>

    <p>The global section \(\Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X (D))\) is a \(\mathbb{C}\)-vector space, so we can set \(\ell (D)=\dim\Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X)\) to be the dimension of the vector space of global holomorphic sections of the sheaf associated to \(D\). Since \(X\) is a Riemann surface, the sheaf \(\Omega_X\) of holomorphic \(1\)-forms is also a locally free sheaf of rank \(1\), and from the result</p>

    <p id="1.3"><div class="s theorem"></div>There is an isomorphism from the abelian group \((I,\otimes)\) of invertible analytic sheaf(i.e. localy free \(\mathcal{O}_X\)-modules of rank \(1\)) and the Picard group.</p>

    <p>we know that \(\Omega_X\) corresponds to some divisor \(K\), which is called the <b class="textbf">canonical divisor</b> of \(X\).</p>

    <p>A final obstruction to the Riemann-Roch theorem is an observation. When \(X\) is compact, then the support of a divisor is a finite set of points, hence we can define the <b class="textbf">degree</b> of one such divisor \(D\) as \(\deg D=\displaystyle\sum_{p\in X} n_p\). Now we can state the Riemann-Roch theorem.</p>

    <p id="classical Riemann-Roch Theorem"><div class="s theorem">(Riemann-Roch)</div>Assume that \((X,j)\) is a compact Riemann surface with complex structure \(j\) and genus \(g\), \(D\) is a divisor on \(X\), then we have the following identity
    $$
    \ell (D)-\ell (K-D)=\deg D-g+1.
    $$
</p>

<p>This gives a correspondence between the algebraic index(the dimension of vector spaces of holomorphic sections, or the vector space of algebraic sections of a line bundle, as well as the degree of this divisor) and the topological index(the genus of the Riemann surface \(X\)). We can use it to derive many results. For a quick example, we can determine the space of holomorphic sections of some given line bundle over a compact Riemann surface, or we can pick special divisors for a special Riemann surface and use this to compute its genus. For different purposes, people try to generlize the Riemann-Roch theorem in different ways. A main approach is to generlize it to higher dimensions and then from absolute version to relative version, which is known as the Grothendieck and Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem. In this seminar we are aiming to introduce another version of Riemann-Roch theorem, which relates the Fredholm index of an elliptic operator to the characteristic number and the genus of the compact Riemann surface with boundary. For readers who want to go into more details of this classical theorem, they can refer to [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ki92">6</a>,<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Sc00">7</a>].</p>

<p><h3 class="subsection">Serre Duality</h3> An important related topic concerning Riemann-Roch theorem is the following Serre's duality theorem, which gives the isomorphism from one cohomology group to the dual of another cohomology group. Once we proved the finiteness of these cohomology groups, it would follow that the two original cohomology groups are isomorphic. Formally for Riemann surface, the theorem reads</p>

<p><div class="s theorem" id="1.5">(Serre Duality)</div>Assume \((X,j)\) is a compact Riemann surface, then there is an isomorphism
$$
    H^p (X,\mathcal{O}_X)\cong H^{1-p} (X,\Omega_X^1)^{\ast}\quad\text{and}\quad H^p (X,\Omega_X^1)\cong H^{1-p} (X,\mathcal{O}_X)^{\ast}.
$$
where \(p=0,1\).
</p>

<p id="1b"><h2 class="section" >1b) Transversality in Floer Theory</h2>In order to introduce Floer theory, we must firstly give some basic concepts about symplectic geometry. We say a <b class="textbf">symplectic manifold</b> of dimension \(2n\) is a differential manifold \(X\) together with a differential \(2\)-form \(\omega\) which is non-degenerate, closed and nowhere vanishing. Let \(\phi\colon X\to Y\) be a smooth map between symplectic manifolds, we say it is a <b class="textbf">symplectomorphism</b> if it is a diffeomorphism and it pulls the symplectic \(2\)-form \(\omega_Y\) back to the symplectic \(2\)-form \(\omega_X\). An isotopy \(\phi_t\colon X\times [0,1]\to Y\) consisting of symplectomorphisms \(\phi_t\colon X\to Y\) for all \(t\) is called a <b class="textbf">symplectic isotopy</b>. A special type of symplectic isotopy is an exact one. That is, there exists a vector field \(\{X_t\}_{0\leq t\leq 1}\) such that
$$
    \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\phi_t =X_t\circ\phi_t.
$$
Moreover, if \(X_t\) is <b class="textbf">Hamiltonian</b>, i.e. there exists a time-dependent smooth function \(H_t\colon Y\times [0,1]\to\mathbb{R}\) such that 
$$
\mathrm{d} H=\omega (\cdot ,X_t),
$$
then we call such an isotopy a <b class="textbf">Hamiltonian isotopy</b>. A submanifold \(L\) of \(X\) is called <b class="textbf">Lagrangian</b> if for each \(x\in X\), \(T_x L\subseteq T_x X\) is a Lagrangian subspace.</p>

<p>An important problem in the twentieth century arose from Poincaré's last geometric theorem is Arnold's conjecture, which states that for a given pair \((X,L)\) where \(X\) compact symplectic(with a topological condition or an involution making \(L\) fixed) and \(L\) its Lagrangian submanifold with a symplectic deformation \(\{\phi_t\}_{0\leq t\leq 1}\) such that \(\phi_1 (L)\pitchfork L\), the number \(\# L\cap\phi_1 (L)\) is bounded below by the sum of Betti numbers of \(L\). A special case of this concerns a more mechanical problem: assuming the existence of a periodic Hamiltonian \(H_t\colon X\times\mathbb{S}^1\to X\), then we would obtain a Hamiltonian vector field \(\{X_t\}\) depending on \(t\), which integrate to a Hamiltonian isotopy \(\{\phi_t\}\). Then Arnold conjectured that the fixed points of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism \(\phi_1\) where we regard \(\mathbb{S}^1\) as the quotient space of \([0,1]\), has a lower bound given by the Betti number of \(X\). Here we must assume that all the fixed points of \(\phi_1\) are non-degenerate. For the definition of this condition, see [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Au14">8</a>]. This text also contains a detailed proof towards one of the special case of the Arnold conjecture.</p>

<p>Floer's approach to this conjecture is to consider an action functional \(\mathcal{A}\) defined on the infinite-dimensional space of smooth paths that starts from \(L\) and ends with \(\phi_1 (L)\), or the space of smooth loops on \(X\). In both cases, we can apply calculus of variations to the action functional and find the critical points, as well as the gradient vector field. Integrating the gradient vector field gives us a non-linear partial differential equation defined on a non-compact Riemann surface \(\Sigma\)(this Riemann surface is a product of the real axis \(\mathbb{R}\) with some unit inteval \(I\) or a unit circle \(\mathbb{S}^1\)), described explicitly as follows. A solution to this PDE consists of a smooth map \(u\colon\Sigma\to X\) satisfying the following identity
$$
\partial_s u+J(u)\partial_t u+\mathrm{grad} H_t (u)=0
$$
where \(J\) is a prescribed almost complex structure defined on \(X\), or we would want a family of almost complex structures so that our given family of Lagrangian subspaces are totally real. This is called the <b class="textbf">Floer equation</b>, or when \(H_t(u)=0\), just the <b class="textbf">non-linear Cauchy-Riemann equation</b>. Solutions to this nonlinear PDE give trajectories connecting critical points. Following an idea of Witten(in his famous paper [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Wi82">9</a>]), if we could compute the dimension of this space, we could then consider the special case when the dimension is \(1\), which combined with compactness property, would allow us to count trajectories to give differentials of the Morse complex generated by critical points, which finally allows us to construct homology and cohomology theories.</p>

<p>In order to compute the dimension, one way is to view the differential operator \(F\) as a smooth section of some Banach bundle \(P\to B\), where \(B\) is some Banach manifold containing our space of solutions. Then the space of solutions would be the zero locus of this section, or in other words, the intersection of the image of \(F\) with \(B\). Now the problem is reduced to the <b class="textbf">transversality property</b>, i.e. on the intersection, we want the tangent space of \(B\) and \(D(B)\) sum up to the tangent space of \(P\). In other words, after taking a linearization \(\mathrm{d}F\), we want the linearization to be surjective and admits a continuous right inverse. This would give a Banach manifold structure to the space of solutions.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#choice of a.c.s.">If \(\mathrm{d} F\) is Fredholm, then it follows that the space of solutions is finite-dimensional.</a> Its dimension is equal to the Fredholm index of \(\mathrm{d} F\), but this is not quite enough for us to compute the dimension, since this calculation involves solving this equation directly. Floer's original approach is to consider "spectral flows", firstly introduced by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer in their paper [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#At75">10</a>], which counts the difference of nagative eigenspaces of the differential operator via time revolution. He then showed that this difference is equal to the Maslov-Viterbo index of the pseudo-holomorphic strip(or the cylinder, depending on what problems we are concerning about) so that we have an explicit, finite-dimensional, and topological description of dimensions of the space of solutions.</p>

<p>In this seminar we are aiming to introduce another approach to explicitly calculating this dimension. This is somwhat a generalization to the classical Riemann-Roch theorem introduced in the previous section, from compact Riemann surfaces to compact Riemann surfaces with boundaries, and from line bundles to general complex vector bundles pairing with a subbundle on the boundary, and from "complex index" to "real index".</p>

<h2 class="section" id="1c">1c) The Generalized Riemann-Roch Theorem</h2>Now we are going to introduce the generalized Riemann-Roch theorem that fits into our motivation. Let \((\Sigma,j)\) a compact Riemann surface with boundary \(\partial \Sigma\) and almost complex structure \(j\colon T\Sigma\to T\Sigma\)(Note that in this case, \(T\Sigma\vert_{\partial \Sigma}\) is also a complex vector space, so we have a well-defined notion of almost complex structures.) Let \(E\to \Sigma\) be a complex vector bundle over \(\Sigma\) with complex structure \(J\). We write \(\Omega^i (\Sigma)\) for the vector space of differential \(k\)-forms on \(\Sigma\), and \(\Omega^{p,q} (\Sigma)\) the vector space of differential forms of type \(p,q\). Given a differentiable complex vector bundle \(E\), we write \(\Omega^{p,q} (\Sigma,E)\) and \(\Omega^k (\Sigma,E)\) to be the vector space of all differential forms with values in \(E\). A <b class="textbf">first order differential operator</b> on \(E\) is a section of the tensor product \(\mathcal{E}\otimes\mathcal{D}^1\), where \(\mathcal{E}\) is the sheaf of smooth sections of \(E\), and \(\mathcal{D}^1\) is the sheaf of Lie algebras with sections of the form \(X+f\), where \(f\) a smooth function and \(X\) a vector field. If we say a differential operator \(D\) is <b class="textbf">homogeneous</b>, we mean the operator belongs to the tangent sheaf \(\mathcal{T}\). For a brief summary of definitions toward these differential forms and differential operators, one can refer to [<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ra04">11</a>, Chapter 2]. 

<p>An important class of examples of such a differential operator are constructed via <b class="textbf">connections</b> on \(E\), which is defined as an \(\mathcal{A}_{\Sigma}\)-linear map \(\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{E}\otimes\Omega^1_{\Sigma} \), or equivalently, a global section of the bundle \(\Omega^1 (\Sigma ,\mathrm{End} (E))\). Notice that fix a vector field \(X\in\Gamma (\Sigma ,\mathcal{T}_{\Sigma} )\) and a connection \(\nabla\), we can associate a differential operator \(\nabla X\) such that for each \(U\subseteq\Sigma\) open and \(s\in\mathcal{E} (U)\),
$$
\nabla X(s)=X\otimes s+\alpha (X)s,
$$
where \(\alpha\in\Omega^1 (U)\) is the corresponding <b class="textbf">connection form</b> of \(\nabla\), that is, the section of the bundle \(\Omega^1 (\Sigma ,\mathrm{End} (E))\).</p>

<p>Now we consider the case of complex vector bundles over a Riemann surface(or a complex manifold)\(\Sigma\). In this case, by the existence of an almost complex structure \(j\) on \(\Sigma\), we can decompose the space \(\Omega^1 (\Sigma )\) of complex-valued differential \(1\)-forms into the direct sum \(\Omega^{1,0} (\Sigma )\oplus\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma )\), and we define the differential operator \(\bar{\partial }\) to be the composition of the exterior differential \(\mathrm{d}\colon\Omega^0 (\Sigma )\to\Omega^1 (\Sigma )\) followed by the projection \(\Omega^1 (\Sigma )\to\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma )\).</p>

<p><div class="s definition" id="1.6"></div>A complex and smooth <b class="textbf">Cauchy-Riemann operator</b> is a differential operator \(D\) on the complex vector bundle \(E\to\Sigma\) such that for each \(f\in\Omega^0 (\Sigma )\) and \(s\in\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E)\) we have the following Lebnitz rule
$$
D(f\otimes s)=f\otimes (Ds)+(\bar{\partial }f)\otimes s.
$$</p>

<p>We can construct Cauchy-Riemann operators via connections.</p>

<p><div class="s definition" id="1.7"></div>Given a complex vector bundle \(E\to X\) over some differentiable manifold \(X\), then an <b class="textbf">hermitian structure</b> on \(E\) is a bilinear function \(h\colon\mathcal{E}\otimes\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{A}_X \) such that it is an hermitian inner product on each fibre \(E_x\) for all \(x\in X\) and the complex structure \(J\) is orthogonal with respect to this hermitian inner product. Given such an hermitian inner product and suppose \(X=\Sigma\), there exists a connection \(\nabla\), called the <b class="textbf">hermitian connection</b> on \(E\), which is defined to be compactible with the hermitian structure \(h\). For such a connection, the complex anti-linear part \(\bar{\partial }^{\nabla} =(\nabla )^{(0,1)}\) is a Cauchy-Riemann operator on \(E\).</p>

<p>Then it's an exercise that each Cauchy-Riemann operator comes from one such hermitian connection(with the given hermitian structure), hence we do not lose any information by choosing such an hermitian structure. Also note that an hermitian structure on any complex vector bundle always exists.</p>

<p>For Riemann surface \(\Sigma\), the complex structure \(j\) together with a fixed volume form \(\mathrm{dvol}\) gives a suitable hermitian structure on \(T\Sigma\) and hence on its dual, so we have the <b class="textbf">Hodge-star operator</b> \(\star\) defined on \(\Omega^{\ast} (\Sigma )\) which maps a differential form \(\omega\) to its orthogonal complement \(\star\omega\). With the hermitian inner product on \(E\) and the volume form on \(T\Sigma\), we could then talking about \(L^2\)-inner products. For \(E\)-valued sections or differential forms \(s_1 ,s_2\), we define their \(L^2\)-product to be the integration
$$
\int_{\Sigma}\langle s_1 ,s_2 \rangle\mathrm{dvol}_{\Sigma},
$$
where the pair \(\langle -,-\rangle\) is the combination of the real part \(\mathrm{Re} h\) of \(h\) and the Hodge-star operator \(\star\). We use the real part instead of the whole hermitian inner product since we know that the real part is a Riemannian metric and, when concerning with real partial differential operators, it's more convenient(and more natural) to work with Riemannian metric than hermitian metric. This difference would be remarked later when we are doing explicit calculations.</p>

<p>Now we have introduced all the necessary notions of defining the "dual operator" toward the Cauchy-Riemann operator \(\bar{\partial }^{\nabla}\), written by \(\bar{\partial }^{\nabla\ast}\). This is given explicitly via the formula
    $$
    \bar{\partial }^{\nabla\ast} =-\star\partial^{\nabla}\bar{\star} =-\star J\partial^{\nabla},
    $$
    and by a direct calculation we know that this is the <b class="textbf">formal adjoint operator</b> to \(\bar{\partial }^{\nabla }\) in the sense of this \(L^2\)-inner product. Also observe that this is the operator \(\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,E)\to\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E)\).
</p>

<p><div class="s remark" ></div>In the case of a Riemann surface with boudary, the boundary data is involved in the definition of adjoint operators. That is, by calculating the integration, we will have the following formula
$$
\int_{\Sigma }\langle D^{\ast}s_1 ,s_2\rangle -\int_{\Sigma }\langle s_1 ,Ds_2\rangle =\int_{\partial\Sigma } \langle s_1 ,Js_2\rangle,
$$
and this coincides with the previous definition if and only if we have \(s_1\perp Js_2\) as vectors in \(E\).</p>

<p>Let's do some local computations. Under a coordinate neighbourhood \((U,z)\) with \(z=s+it\) we have the corresponding differential operators \(\nabla_s\) and \(\nabla_t\) given by
    $$
    \nabla_s =\partial_s +\Phi\quad\text{and}\quad\nabla_t =\partial_t +\Psi, 
$$
where \(\Phi\) and \(\Psi\) are corresponding endomorphisms in \(\mathfrak{u}(n)\). The Cauchy-Riemann operator reads
$$
\bar{\partial }^{\nabla}\xi=(\nabla)^{0,1} \xi=\frac{1}{2} (\nabla_s \xi+J\nabla_t \xi)\mathrm{d} s+\frac{1}{2} (\nabla_t \xi -J\nabla_s \xi )\mathrm{d} t,
$$
and the formal adjoint operator is given by
$$
\bar{\partial }^{\nabla\ast}\xi (\mathrm{d} s-i\mathrm{d} t)=\lambda^{-2} (-\nabla_s\xi +i\nabla_t\xi ),
$$
where \(\mathrm{dvol} =\lambda^2\mathrm{d} s\wedge\mathrm{d} t\) is the volume form on \(U\). Therefore this gives an explicit formula for the formal adjoint operator locally: for any \(\zeta\mathrm{d}\bar{z}\), we have \(\bar{\partial }^{\nabla\ast } (\zeta\mathrm{d}\bar{z} )=-2\lambda^{-2}\partial^{\nabla}\zeta\).</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Real Linear Cauchy-Riemann Operator.</h3> Finally we reach our main object of discussion. We have defined and discussed the complex and smooth Cauchy-Riemann operator as a component of some hermitian connection, but what we meet with in Floer theory, or in pseudo-holomorphic curves is a slightly general one, which is real and non-smooth. Before that, let's discuss the boundary conditions. We say a subbundle \(F\subseteq E\) is <b class="textbf">totally real</b> if it is invariant under conjugation. In a symplectic vector space, for a Lagrangian subspace we can choose a proper compactible almost complex structure so that the Lagrangian subspace would be automatically totally real. We call a <b class="textbf">bundle pair</b> \((E,F)\) to be a pair consisting of a vector bundle \(E\to\Sigma\) over \(\Sigma\) and a totally real subbundle \(F\) over the boundary \(\partial\Sigma\). For this bundle pair, we define the corresponding space of differential forms to be
$$
\Omega^k (\Sigma ;E,F)=\{s\in\Omega^k (\Sigma ,E)\vert s\vert_{\partial\Sigma }\in\Omega^k (\Sigma ,F)\}
$$
and
$$
\Omega^{p,q} (\Sigma ;E,F)=\{s\in\Omega^{p,q} (\Sigma ,E)\vert s\vert_{\partial\Sigma }\in\Omega^{p,q} (\Sigma ,F)\}.
$$
Now we set \(W^{k,p}_F (\Sigma ;\bigwedge^p T^{\ast}\Sigma\otimes E)\) to be the associated Sobolev space of differential \(p\)-forms or \((p,q)\)-forms.

<p><div class="s definition" id="1.8"></div>For given positive integer \(k\) and a real number \(p>1\) such that \(kp>2\), we set a <b class="textbf">real linear Cauchy-Riemann operator</b> on \((E,F)\) of class \(W^{k-1,p}\) to be the differential operator \(D=D_0 +\alpha \) where \(D_0\) is a smooth complex Cauchy-Riemann operator and \(\alpha\in W^{k-1,p} (\Sigma ,\bigwedge^{0,1} T^{\ast}\Sigma\otimes\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb{R}} (E))\).</p>

<p>Here we must impose the condition \(kp>2\) because of the Sobolev embedding theorem, which states that only when \(kp>2\) can Sobolev spaces embedded into the space of continuous functions, so all sections are continuous. It's an exercise that for a given real linear Cauchy-Riemann operator \(D\), we have</p>

<p><div class="s lemma" id="1.9"></div>Any real linear Cauchy-Riemann operator of class \(W^{k-1, p}\) is gauge equivalent to some complex smooth Cauchy-Riemann operator.</p>

<p>Then one who is familiar with functional analysis would expect that the Fredholm property is preserved when we replace such a non-smooth Cauchy-Riemann operator by the corresponding complex and smooth one.</p>

<p>A final preparation is to compute the corresponding formal adjoint operator related to a given real-linear Cauchy-Riemann operator \(D_F\) of class \(W^{k-1,p}\) defined on a subspace \(W_F^{k,p} (\Sigma ,E)\). For the original one defined on the whole space without boundary conditions, we have done the computation, except for the real linear term \(\alpha\), but notice that under the \(L^2\)-inner product, the formal adjoint of this zero-order term \(\alpha\) is just the transpose \(\alpha^T\), so we have obtained the formal adjoint \(D^{\ast}_F \) as an operator defined on the space \(W^{k,p} (\Sigma ,E)\) of all sections of Sobolev type. When we impose boundary conditions, we have</p>

<p><div class="s lemma" id="formal-adjointness"></div>For any \(\xi\in \Omega^0 (\Sigma ;E,F)\) and \(\eta\in \Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ;E,F)\), we have
$$
\int_{\Sigma }\langle D_F^{\ast}\eta ,\xi\rangle\mathrm{dvol} =\int_{\Sigma }\langle\eta ,D_F\xi\rangle\mathrm{dvol}.
$$</p>

<p class="proof">We only need to verify the boundary conditions. Observe that in this case, since \(F\) is totally real, \(JF\) is orthogonal to \(F\) and therefore we have \(\xi\perp J\eta\) for any vector-valued differential forms \(\xi\) and \(\eta\) satisfying the given boundary condition.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">The Generalized Riemann-Roch Theorem.</h3> With all these preparations, we would then give an explicit statement of the main theorem of this seminar. This main result consists of three parts, the first is the analytical part, which states that the Cauchy-Riemann operator constructed above has the Fredholm property, so we could associate an analytic index, the Fredholm index of this operator. The second statement relates this analytic index to the topological index concerning the Riemann surface \(\Sigma\) as well as the relative Chern number, i.e. the Maslov index of the bundle pairs \((E,F)\) and the Euler characteristic \(\chi (\Sigma)\). The last statement computes the index in the case when the relative Chern number is sufficiently large or sufficiently small. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#holomorphic or algebraic line bundle">This coincides with the usual application of Riemann-Roch theorem that tells us the degree of a divisor determines the existence of global sections over some holomorphic</a> line bundle.

<p><div class="s theorem" id="generalized-Riemann-Roch">(Generalized Riemann-Roch)</div>Let \((E,F))\) be a bundle pair and \(D_F\) a real linear Cauchy-Riemann operator on \((E,F)\) of class \(W^{\ell -1,p}\) where \(\ell p>2\) and \(p>1\). Then the following holds for every integer \(k\in\{1,2,\dotsb,\ell\}\) and every real number \(q>1\) such that \(k-\frac{2}{q}\leq\ell -\frac{2}{p}\). 
<ol class="thm">

<p><div class="s remark"></div>This theorem consists of three parts. The first part is the finiteness of solutions toward the Cauchy-Riemann equation(or finiteness of the space of holomorphic or meromorphic sections over a compact Riemann surface, in the classical setting), and the second part is the explicit formula for the Fredholm index of \(D_F\). From the second part we see directly the relationship between analytic index, the Fredholm index of \(D_F\) and the topological index, the Euler characteristic of \(\Sigma\) and the boundary Maslov index of the bundle pair \((E,F)\). The final part of the theorem states the two vanishing results, like in the classical case, that when a degree of a divisor is negative then the corresponding line bundle has no non-trivial global sections, and when it is sufficiently large, the dimension of this space of holomorphic sections just coincides with the right-hand sum of topological indices.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Serre Duality.</h3>We are again going to talk about the important duality result in this context. The discussion in this paragraph assumes theorem <a href="#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>, so we will obtain some quick results. 

<p>The construction just goes parallel to the classical one. But in this case, \(E\) is a general complex vector bundle, we canno assume there is a group structure on the space of all such vector bundles modulo isomorphism, so we introduce the dual vector bundle \(E^{\ast}\) and use the tensor product \(\wedge^{0,1} T^{\ast}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast}\) as the subsitution of the vector bundle \(\Omega_X^1\) in the previous statement. We want to construct a pairing in this context.</p>

<p>Note that \(E^{\ast} =\Hom (E,\mathbb{C} )\), and the corresponding almost complex structure \(J\) on \(E\) is also defined this way, so we have a corresponding totally real subbundle \(F^{\ast}\) given by
    $$
    F^{\ast}_z =\{(z,\mu)\in E^{\ast}\vert\mu (F_z)\subseteq\mathbb{R}\}.
    $$
    It is not hard to verify that \(F_z^{\ast}\) is a totally real subbundle of \(E^{\ast}\). 
</p>

<p>The second work is to concern differential forms on \(E^{\ast}\). The \(\mathbb{C}\)-linear dual bundle \(\Hom (T\Sigma ,\mathbb{C} )\) of \(T\Sigma\) is the cotangent subbundle of \(T^{\ast}\Sigma\) consisting only of complex linear differential forms, and we set \(T^{1,0}\Sigma\) for this cotangent bundle. Then it follows that we have the tensor product \(T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast}\cong\Hom (T\Sigma ,E^{\ast})\), and on the boundary \(\partial\Sigma\), we just have \(T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes F^{\ast} =T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast}\vert_{\partial\Sigma}\).</p>

<p>We can then form the pairing 
    $$
    \Omega^0 (\Sigma ,T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast})\otimes\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,E)\to\mathbb{C}
    $$
    by setting \((\xi ,\eta)\mapsto\displaystyle\int_{\Sigma}\xi\wedge\eta\). Likewise, when we consider the space of differential \((0,1)\)-forms with values in the vector bundle \(T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{ast}\), with the natural pairing \(E\otimes E^{\ast}\to\mathbb{C}\) we have the pairing
    $$
    \Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast})\otimes\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E)\to\mathbb{C},
    $$
    and the Riesz representation theorem for the \(L^2\)-inner product gives us the isomorphism from the first component to the dual of the second, assuming that they are complete Hilbert spaces with respect to the given \(L^2\)-inner product.
</p>

<p>But this is not the case, so we would like to go further looking at these pairings. A first remark on complex geometry is that</p>

<p><div class="s theorem">([<a href="seminar-Riemann-Roch.html#Ko87">13</a>])</div>Any Cauchy-Riemann operator defined on a complex vector bundle \(E\to X\) over some complex manifold \(X\) determines a unique holomorphic structure on \(E\).</p>

<p>In complex geometry setting, we require the Cauchy-Riemann operator to satisfy the condition \((\bar{\partial }^{\nabla })^2 =0\), which is trivial for Riemann surface. Thus any complex vector bundles \(E\) over a Riemann surface \(\Sigma\) are holomorphic.</p>

<p>Then we could fix a holomorphic structure on \(E\) so that there exists a unique Cauchy-Riemann operator \(\bar{\partial}\) that is compactible with the holomorphic structure(i.e. this is the \((0,1)\)-part of a Chern connection). Then any other Cauchy-Riemann operator \(D\) can be then written as the sum
    $$
    D=\bar{\partial }+A\colon\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E)\to\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,E)
    $$
    where \(A\in\Gamma (\Sigma ,\mathfrak{u} (E)\otimes\wedge^{0,1}\Sigma)\) is an \(1\)-form with value in the Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{u} (E)\). The "dual operator" can then be written as
    $$
    D^{\ast} =-\bar{\partial} +A^{\ast}\colon\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,\wedge^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E)\to\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,\wedge^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E). 
    $$
    Here the dual operator is not the same as what we have constructed before, but they are actually closely related. For any \(\xi\in\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E)\) and \(\eta\in\Omega^{1,0} (\Sigma ,E^{\ast})=\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E^{\ast}\otimes T^{1,0}\Sigma)\) we have
    $$
    D^{\ast}\eta\wedge\xi -\eta\wedge D\xi =\diff (\eta\wedge\xi )\in\Omega^{1,1} (\Sigma ),
    $$
    so via integration, we obtain that
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{\Sigma} (D^{\ast}\eta\wedge\xi -\eta\wedge D\xi )=\int_{\partial\Sigma}\eta\wedge\xi.\label{formula-adjoint-integration}
    \end{equation}
</p>

<p><div class="s crl" id="Serre-duality-for-gRR"></div>Assume \(D\) as constructed above with \(A\) of class \(W^{\ell -1,p}\) and the bundle pair \((E,F)\) defined as in theorem <a href="#generalized-Riemann-Roch">1.12</a>, then for any \(\eta\in L^r (\Sigma ,T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast} )\) with \(r>1\), the following two statements are equivalent:
<ol class="thm">
    <li>\(\int_{\Sigma }\eta\wedge D\xi\in\mathbb{R}\) for any \(\xi\in\Omega^0_F (\Sigma ,E)\);</li>
    <li>\(\eta\) is of class \(W^{\ell ,p}\), \(D^{\ast}\eta =0\) and \(\eta (\partial\Sigma )\subseteq F\). In other words, \(\eta\in W_F^{\ell ,p} (\Sigma ,T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast})\).</li>
</ol></p>

<p>This theorem generalizes the Serre duality in the following sense: combining with generalized Riemann-Roch theorem, we then obtain in the following two elliptic complexes
    \begin{equation}
    0\rightarrow W^{\ell ,p}_F (\Sigma ,E)\xrightarrow{D_F} W^{\ell -1,p} (\Sigma ,T^{0,1}\Sigma\otimes E)\rightarrow 0
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation}
    0\rightarrow W^{\ell ,p}_F (\Sigma ,T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast})\xrightarrow{D_F^{\ast}} W^{\ell -1,p} (\Sigma ,T^{1,1}\Sigma\otimes E)\rightarrow 0
    \end{equation}

</p>

<p class="proof">From formula \eqref{formula-adjoint-integration} we know that (ii) implies (i). Conversely, assume (i) is true, pick a Riemannian metric \(g\) on \(\Sigma\) compactible with the assumed almost complex structure on \(\Sigma\), then we obtain a metric on the tensor bundle \(T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast}\) and also on \(T^{0,1}\Sigma\otimes E\) so that the natural pairing gives a linear map
    $$
    L^r (\Sigma ,T^{1,0}\Sigma\otimes E^{\ast})\rightarrow (\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,E))^{\ast}
    $$
    given by assigning to each \(\eta\) the linear function \(\langle\eta ,-\rangle\). <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#conjugate-index">Let \(q\) be the conjugate index to \(r\)</a>, then we know that the above linear map is an isomorphism, and we can extend \(\Omega^{0,1} (\Sigma ,E)\) to the space \(L^q (\Sigma ,T^{0,1}\Sigma\otimes E)\) of differential \((0,1)\)-forms of class \(L^q\). We could then complete \(\Omega^0 (\Sigma ,E)\) to the space \(W^{1,q} (\Sigma ,E)\). Note that we can identify \(E^{\ast}\) with \(E\) via the hermitian inner product \(h\), and \(\langle -,-\rangle\) is given exactly by pairing the differential forms and using the hermitian inner product to pairing \(E\) and \(E^{\ast}\). We could then decompose \(\langle -,-\rangle\) into the real parts and imagine parts
    $$
    \langle -,-\rangle =(-,-)+i(-,J-).
    $$
    We now come back to our computation. For \(\xi\in W^{1,q}_F (\Sigma ,E)\), we have
    $$
    0=\iIm\int_{\Sigma}\eta\wedge D\xi =\int_{\Sigma } (J\eta ,D\xi) =-\int_{\Sigma} (\eta ,JD\xi) =-\int_{\Sigma}  \langle\eta ,D\xi\rangle_{E\otimes T^{0,1}\Sigma}\dvol,
    $$ 
    where the last inner product is defined by the product of the hermitian metric on \(E\) and that on \(T^{0,1}\Sigma\). This tells us that \(\eta\) lies in the orthogonal complement of \(\im D_F\), hence from Riemann-Roch theorem <a href="#generalized-Riemann-Roch" class="thm">1.12</a>, the image \(\im D_F\) is the annihilator of the kernel \(\ker D_F^{\ast}\subseteq L^r (\Sigma ,T^{0,1}\Sigma\otimes E)\), and since \(L^p\) spaces are reflexive Banach spaces, the annihilator of an annihilator of a closed subspace coincides with the closed subspace itself. Therefore \(\eta\in\ker D_F^{\ast}\) and hence \(\eta\) is of class \(W^{\ell ,p}\) and satisfies the given boundary condition. To verify \(D^{\ast}\eta =0\), just recall the identity \eqref{formula-adjoint-integration}.
